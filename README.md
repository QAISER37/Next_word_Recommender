### Next-Word Prediction with RNN and LSTM

This project focuses on developing predictive models using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures for next-word prediction. The models are trained on the "Pride and Prejudice" text data by Jane Austen. 

#### Key Features:
- Data preprocessing to cleanse and tokenize text data.
- Implementation of RNN and LSTM architectures.
- Model training and evaluation.
- User-friendly prediction function for next-word anticipation.

#### How to Use:
1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Run the provided Python script to train the models and generate predictions.

#### Requirements:
- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Keras

#### Credits:
This project was developed as part of an internship program under the Intern Infotech Virtual Learning Internship Program.
